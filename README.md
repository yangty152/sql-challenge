# sql-challenge
* This repository contains files for SQL Challenge homework, please see the folder structure as below:
* Images - contains screenshots for the ERD diagram, histogram and the bar chart from the bonus section
* SQLScripts - contains two scripts, one is the create tables script, and the other one is the query script for the data analysis.
* Bonus.ipynb - Data analysis from the bonus section, however, I didn't using the youtube method to hide the password (couldn't get it work with time I have), so I just created a seperate password file (pw.py), and removed the password before the commit.
